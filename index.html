		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<div id="div1">
		<p>Hello, my name is Ashley Morton and I am a senior Computer Science Major at Kansas State University. I have been a student at K-State 
		since spring of 2015 and have an expected graduation date of May 2019. I originally started my college career in 2011 at Cloud County Community College 
		where I earned my CNA license with a 4.0 GPA. Starting in 2012 I attended courses at Barton Community College 
		where I graduated in 2014 with a 3.7 GPA for my Associates in Science degree. For this degree I focused on Business Management and Leadership. 
		Before graduating from Barton I took some time to visit New York where I attended the Tattoo Learning Center. During my time here I was able to fulfill my life-long 
		dream of becoming a tattoo artist. Upon coming back to Kansas I decided to spend a couple of years tattooing where I met a lot of fun and interesting 
		people but knew I wanted to expand my skill-set. In 2013 I took a job as the assistant manager at Houlihan's in Manhattan, KS where I worked until early 2016. When I decided to transfer 
		and continue my education at K-State I had originally wanted to try my hand at Electrical Engineering. After a long sit-down with the dean of 
		Engineering he gave me two choices: Quit my full-time job and enroll in Electrical Engineering; Keep my job for the time being and try a 
		different major. I had mentioned I tried my hand at software development in high school as well as my being proficient with web development 
		so he had recommended that I try Computer Science thus starting my wonderful journey in Computer Science.

		<p>While at K-state I have jumped over my fair amount or hurdles. I started off strong transferring in with a 3.7 from Barton and had a 3.5 after my first semester.
		Unfortunately I spent half of my first Summer Session at K-State in a hospital bed. I had been bitten by a brown recluse spider and the necrosis wouldn't stop. 
		On top of that I had contracted an infection from the bite which eventually left me unable to move my leg. That session had been tough but I powered through.
		Getting into the Fall Semester of 2015 I had reached my third trimester with my pregnancy and had started having problems walking. I'd try to make it to my classes 
		but wouldn't make it to the end of the parking lot. This semester was my first taste of failure in academia and it was very bitter. Spring of 2016 brought on new 
		challenges. I struggled to juggle full-time student status on top of being a single mother and had unfortunately lead to more failure. Even after two rough semesters back-to-back 
		I still entered the Fall 2016 semester with a smile and hope. I had everything ready and had everything set up. Unfortunately that's where I found myself facing multiple 
		childcare issues which lead to a lot of missed classes. I kept trying and telling myself that I would pull through this and that I could make it work. I believed it and I had 
		started to redeem myself but unfortunately it was harder to make a comeback than I had thought. 2016 had me beaten and battered and facing termination from K-State.
		Fortunately I was reinstated and was able to return immediately for the Spring 2017 semester. By now I had fallen below a 2.2 GPA and had a far way to climb. Spring 2017 
		brought great success and was deemed my "comeback semester." This was my chance to prove that I could finish this degree and I did just that. Fall 2016 brought greater 
		success and I had brought my GPA back up to a 2.75. I am actively working on bringing my GPA up and proving to myself that I can still do this. I currently stand at a 2.8 GPAand am well 
		on my way to a 3.0 by graduation.
